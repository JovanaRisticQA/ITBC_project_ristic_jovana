# ITBC_project_ristic_jovana

This is the final project for the courseÂ IT Bootcamp - Software Testing (manual and automation). The assignment was to manually test features on the website [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com/) and to automate some of them.


The following tools and technologies were used for the automation:
* programming language: Java
* automation library: Selenium WebDriver
* testing framework: TestNG
* design pattern: POM


Pages automated so far:
* Buttons
* Radio Buttons
* Register to Book Store
* Selectable
* Text Box
* Tool Tips
* Upload and Download


To check the tests on your computer, you will have to replace the Chrome WebDriver path (BaseTests.java, line 50) with your WebDriver path.

For tests in the class UploadAndDownloadTests.java, you will also have to replace the current String imageDownloadPath (UploadAndDownloadPage.java, line 24) with your default download folder path.
